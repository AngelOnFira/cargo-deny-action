GitHub Action for running [`cargo-deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) to help manage Cargo crate dependencies and validate licenses.

üöß This repo is still work-in-progress `v0`, feel free to test it but avoid rely on it until `v1` (see [#1](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action/issues/1)) üöß

## Usage

Create a `deny.toml` file in the root of the repo to use as rules for the action ([example](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/blob/master/deny.toml)).
See [`cargo-deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) for instructions and details of the format and capabilities.

This action will run `cargo-deny check` and report failure if any banned crates or disallowed open souce licenses are found used in the crate or its dependencies.

### Example pipeline

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

  cargo-deny:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
